    title: "I am a Software Engineer,",
    description: `
          I'm a passionate and driven software engineer with a solid foundation in full-stack development. Skilled in modern frontend technologies, including ReactJS, NextJS, and Redux, I build dynamic and responsive web applications with a focus on user experience. My backend expertise lies in NodeJS, particularly with the Express framework, where I create RESTful APIs and implement real-time communication using WebSocket.
      
          I have hands-on experience with OAuth and have integrated it across multiple projects for secure user authentication. My enthusiasm for AI/ML has led me to work on diverse projects, including sentiment analysis and recommender systems, applying my understanding of machine learning to solve real-world problems.
      
          Experienced in both relational (MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases, I work comfortably with structured and unstructured data. As a technology enthusiast, I'm always eager to embrace new challenges and contribute to the team in meaningful ways.`
